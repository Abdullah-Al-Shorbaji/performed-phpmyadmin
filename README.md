Hello everyone,

Here is my Wunder's task performance, that can be do it after intiate the docker engine as following:
1. Homepage has one link, behind it you will see all notes stored into a spesific database (There are already notes exist).
2. With notes you will see links: Add note on the above and (Show note, update note and delete note) down each note.
3. Add note: when you click it, you can add a title and a text of note, submit it and you will automatically return back to homepage to see your new note in JSON format
4. Show note: when click it, you will see the information of the note in JSON format.
4. Update note: when you click it, you will see note data you clicked transferred automatically, update it as you want and when you finished click submit and  will automatically 
   return back to homepage to see your new update on the note also in JSON format
5. Delete note: you can only click it and note will deleted automatically and you return back to homepage automatically.


Note: inside of Route, Templates; Forms, and controllers files you will see some comments beside my name "Abdullah" to describe the codes.
